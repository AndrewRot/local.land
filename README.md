For our project, we created a website destination for farmers' markets. We had a blast making this website! Enjoy!

----------PAGE DESCRIPTION-----------
Home Page: This page allows for a user to enter a destination that they wish to discover nearby markets. The user can enter any form of destination criteria (zip code, lat/long, town, etc.). Once the user hits the enter key or presses "Search", the page will auto scroll to a Google Map centered around the entered location. The farmer's markets are represented by our logo. The logos can be clicked on to display a modal detailing the market's location, hours, seasons, products, links, and Facebook links. The side bar featured on the left expands on click and allows for the user to see a list of featured markets in that map radius. The user can click on the map to auto-center the map on the selected market.

About: This page is a description of the group members. We are all pretty cool I think.

Ambassadors: This page allows for users that wish to get behind the company to help us market. The more marketing we have, the more successful our company will be in sharing the movement!

Contact: This page allows for the owner of a farmers market to add their market to the database. Once the form is submitted, the market will appear on the map.

Data: This is a data visualization of the number of farmers markets in each state.  

Instafeed: This is a proof-of-concept for an Instagram feed of images tagged with "localland". Obviously the Instagrams displayed aren't actually tagged with "localland" (since we aren't a company yet), so we used a temp tag instead.
